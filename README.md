# Create-Conquer-2025-Hackathon
We have successfully developed a complete prototype via Figma, that shows the full UI/UX design of the system. The prototype contains important panels and user flows to adequately show the interface and user experience from beginning to end. The next development stages will be able to refer to this visual prototype that they will be building out.
