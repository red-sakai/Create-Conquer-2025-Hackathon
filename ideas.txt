HACKATHON THEME #1

CORE PROBLEM: Tools like Notion, Asana, ClickUp, and Jira optimize for information management, not user experience

QuestBoard
- Projects as quests
- Tasks as missions
- Team members as heroes (Boss: Wizard King, Knight: Backend Dev, Wizard: Frontend Dev)
- EXP, Badges, Streaks, Rewards, etc... (Progress Bar, EXP Points System)
- Health Points (As time nears deadline HP decreases)
